## 3.6 Modifier Vocabulary

Modifiers provide additional information about the action such as time, periodicity, duration, and location. Modifiers can denote the when, where, and how aspects of an action. The modifier can also be used to convey the need for additional status information about the execution of an action. Modifiers can be used to indicate whether the actuator should explicitly acknowledge receipt of the command, respond upon completion of the execution of the command, or provide some other status information. The requested status/information will be carried in a RESPONSE. Refer to Section 4.6.

Modifiers are similar to specifiers in that they can provide additional context specific details for an action, and are intended to provide additional details for action/target pairs. Action-specific modifiers are identified in the sections detailing out each action.

The following table lists the set of universal modifiers that are applicable to all types of actions.
