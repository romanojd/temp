# FOREWORD

The Open Command and Control Forum (OpenC2 or the Forum) supports the cyber defense community of interest. The Open Command and Control Forum promotes the global development and adoption of the OpenC2 language and reference material.

This Forum serves developers, users, and the entire cybersecurity ecosystem by providing a set of shared resources to expand the use of standardized command and control for cyber defense activities, to enable technology vendors building orchestration and cyber response technologies, and to assist developers in producing response technologies that can be readily used in coordinated responses. The goal of the Forum is to present its findings and artifacts to recognized standards bodies for the open standardization of the command and control language.

This document represents the outcome of collaboration between technology vendors, government agencies, and academia on the topic of command and control for cyber defensive measures. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions to the definition of the OpenC2 language. As we exercise the language in reference implementations, we expect to continue to refine the language to ensure its suitability to support machine-to-machine command and control communications in response to cyber threats in cyber-relevant time.
