## [3.3 Actions](3.3_actions.md#33-actions)

## 3.4 Target Vocabulary
The TARGET is the object of the ACTION (or alternatively, the ACTION is performed on the TARGET). OpenC2 will utilize pre-existing data models to provide the namespace for the TARGETs. This document will reference the applicable CybOX objects in the OpenC2 TARGET namespace. However, the OpenC2 syntax supports custom or other data models. Refer to the following table for a summary of the OpenC2 TARGET Namespaces.

**Table 3-6. Target Namespace**

| Type | Description | Options | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| namespace | Used to uniquely identify a set of names so there is no ambiguity; defines the context in which names are defined. | Choice of:<br>  CybOX Version<br>  OpenC2<br>  Custom | 

Targets include objects such as network connections, URLs, hashes, IP addresses, files, processes, and domains. Refer to the following table for a summary of the supported OpenC2 TARGETs in the CybOX 2.1 Namespace (http://cybox.mitre.org/cybox-2).
