## [3.2 Abstract Syntax](3.0_openc2-language.md#32-abstract-syntax)

## 3.3 Actions

This section defines the set of OpenC2 actions grouped by their general activity. The following table summarizes the definition of the OpenC2 actions. Subsequent sections will identify the appropriate targets for each action and the appropriate actuators for the action target pair.

### 3.3.1 Actions that Gather and Convey Information

These actions are used to gather information needed to further determine courses of action or assess the effectiveness of courses of action. These actions can be used to support data enrichment use cases and maintain situational awareness. These actions typically do not impact the state of the target and are normally not detectable by external observers.

### 3.3.2 Actions that Control Permissions

These actions are used to control permissions and accesses. The permissions and accesses can be for person or non-person entities.

### 3.3.3 Actions that Control Activities/Devices

These actions are used to control the state or the activity of a system, a process, a connection, a host, or a device (e.g., endpoint, sensor, actuator). The actions are used to adjust configurations, set and update parameters, and modify attributes.

### 3.3.4 Sensor-Related Actions

These actions are used to control the activities of a sensor in terms of how to collect and provide the sensor data.

### 3.3.5 Effects-Based Actions

Effects-based actions are at a higher level of abstraction and focus on the desired impact rather than a command to execute specific task(s) within an enclave. The benefit of including effects-based actions is that it permits a higher level or peer enclave to coordinate actions, while still permitting a local enclave to optimize its workflow for its specific environment in order to achieve the desired result.

Implementation of an effects-based action requires that the recipient enclave has a decision making capability because an effects-based action permits multiple possible responses.

### 3.3.6 Response and Alert

RESPONSE is used to provide data requested as a result of an action. The RESPONSE message will contain the requested data and have a reference to the action that initiated the response. ALERT is used to signal the occurrence of an event or error. It is an unsolicited message that does not reference a previously issued action.

**Table 3-5. Summary of Action Definitions**

|  | **Actions that Control Permissions** | 
| [DENY](actions/deny.md#deny) | The DENY action is used to prevent a certain event or action from completion, such as preventing a flow from reaching a destination (e.g., block) or preventing access. | 
| [CONTAIN](actions/contain.md#contain) | The CONTAIN action stipulates the isolation of a file or process or entity such that it cannot modify or access assets or processes that support the business and/or operations of the enclave. | 
| [ALLOW](actions/allow.md#allow) | The ALLOW action permits the access to or execution of something.  | 
|  | **Actions that Control Activities/Devices** | 
| [START](actions/start.md#start) | The START action initiates a process, application, system or some other activity. | 
| [STOP](actions/stop.md#stop) | The STOP action halts a system or ends an activity. | 
| [RESTART](actions/restart.md#restart) | The RESTART action conducts a STOP of a system or an activity followed by a START of a system or an activity. | 
| [PAUSE](actions/pause.md#pause) | The PAUSE action ceases a system or activity while maintaining state. | 
| [RESUME](actions/resume.md#resume) | The RESUME action starts a system or activity from a paused state. | 
| [CANCEL](actions/cancel.md#cancel) | The CANCEL action invalidates a previously issued action. | 
| [SET](actions/set.md#set) | The SET action changes a value, configuration, or state of a managed entity within an IT system. | 
| [UPDATE](actions/update.md#update) | The UPDATE action instructs the component to retrieve and process a software update, reconfiguration, or some other update. | 
| [MOVE](actions/move.md#move) | The MOVE action changes the location of a file, subnet, network, or, process. | 
| [REDIRECT](actions/redirect.md#redirect) | The REDIRECT action changes the flow of traffic to a particular destination other than its original intended destination. | 
| [DELETE](actions/delete.md#delete) | The DELETE action removes data and files. | 
| [SNAPSHOT](actions/snapshot.md#snapshot) | The SNAPSHOT action records and stores the state of a target at an instant in time. | 
| [DETONATE](actions/detonate.md#detonate) | The DETONATE action executes and observes the behavior of an object (e.g., file, hyperlink) in a manner that isolates the object from assets that support the business or operations of the enclave. | 
| [RESTORE](actions/restore.md#restore) | The RESTORE action deletes and/or replaces files, settings, or attributes such that the state of the system is identical to its state at some previous time. | 
| [SAVE](actions/save.md#save) | The SAVE action commits data or system state to memory. | 
| [MODIFY](actions/modify.md#modify) | The MODIFY action augments, enhances, transforms, or changes some aspect of a system. | 
| [THROTTLE](actions/throttle.md#throttle) | The THROTTLE action adjusts the throughput of a data flow. | 
| [DELAY](actions/delay.md#delay) | The DELAY action stops or holds up an activity or data transmittal. | 
| [SUBSTITUTE](actions/substitute.md#substitute) | The SUBSTITUTE action replaces all or part of the data, content or payload in the least detectable manner. | 
| [COPY](actions/copy.md#copy) | The COPY action duplicates a file or data flow. | 
| [SYNC](actions/sync.md#sync) | The SYNC action synchronizes a sensor or actuator with other system components. | 
|  | **Sensor-Related Actions** | 
| [DISTILL](actions/distill.md#distill) | The DISTILL action tasks the sensor to send a summary or abstraction of the sensing information instead of the raw data feed. | 
| [AUGMENT](actions/augment.md#augment) | The AUGMENT action tasks the sensor to do a level of preprocessing or sense making prior to sending the sensor data. | 
|  | **Effects-Based Actions** | 
| [INVESTIGATE](actions/investigate.md#investigate) | The INVESTIGATE action tasks the recipient enclave to aggregate and report information as it pertains to an anomaly. | 
| [MITIGATE](actions/mitigate.md#mitigate) | The MITIGATE action tasks the recipient enclave to circumvent the problem without necessarily eliminating the vulnerability or attack point.<br>Mitigate implies that the impacts to the enclaveâ€™s operations should be minimized while addressing the issue. | 
| [REMEDIATE](actions/remediate.md#remediate) | The REMEDIATE action tasks the recipient enclave to eliminate the vulnerability or attack point.<br>Remediate implies that addressing the issue is paramount. | 
|  | **Response and Alert** | 
| [RESPONSE](actions/response.md#response) | RESPONSE is used to provide any data requested as a result of an action. RESPONSE can be used to signal the acknowledgement of an action, provide the status of an action along with additional information related to the requested action, or signal the completion of the action. The recipient of the RESPONSE can be the original requester of the action or to another recipient(s) designated in the modifier of the action. | 
| [ALERT](actions/alert.md#alert) | ALERT is used to signal the occurrence of an event. |
